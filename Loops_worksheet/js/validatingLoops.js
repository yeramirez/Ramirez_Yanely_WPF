 //Make up a problem for the user to solve

 //Let's determine how much time it takes to listen to our playlist


 //We will first prompt the user for a amount of time (that they will listen to music)

 var songs = prompt("How many songs are on your playlist?");

 //We will then prompt the user for the average time a song in the playlist

 var songTime = prompt("On average, how long are the songs you are listening to (minutes)?");

 //Now we will do the math

 var totalTime = (songs * songTime) / 60;
