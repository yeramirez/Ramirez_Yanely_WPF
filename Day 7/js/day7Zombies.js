 //Zombie Attack!!
 //We have a zombie at the school.
 //It can bite four people a day and turn them into zombies by the next day.
 //The CDC has asked us, how many zombies will there be in 8 days?

 //Setup variables

 var numZombies = 1; // How many zombies do we have

 var numBites = 4; // Number of bites. per zombie per day

 var days = 8; // Number of days

 //Every day zombies will bite 4 people and turn them into zombies

 //Loop number of days

  //How many new zombies get made and when do they go bite people.
  var newZombies = numZombies*numBites;

  //The bitten people now become zombies
  numZombies=newZombies+numZombies; //numZombies += newZombies
